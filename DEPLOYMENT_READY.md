**Verify Rollback**:
```bash
curl -I http://misopin.com/index.html
# Should return HTTP 200
```

### If JavaScript Fails to Load

```bash
# Check file exists
ssh root@141.164.60.51 "ls -la /var/www/misopin.com/js/clinic-info.js"

# Fix permissions
ssh root@141.164.60.51 "chmod 644 /var/www/misopin.com/js/clinic-info.js"

# Re-upload if needed
scp ./js/clinic-info.js root@141.164.60.51:/var/www/misopin.com/js/
```

### If Page Returns 404

```bash
# Check file exists
ssh root@141.164.60.51 "ls -la /var/www/misopin.com/*.html"

# Fix permissions
ssh root@141.164.60.51 "chmod 644 /var/www/misopin.com/*.html"

# Rollback if files missing
